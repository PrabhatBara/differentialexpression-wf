## Introduction

**nf-core/differentialexpression** is a bioinformatics pipeline that can be used to analyse data represented as matrices, comparing groups of observations to generate differential statistics and downstream analyses. The initial feature set is built around RNA-seq, but we anticipate rapid expansion to include other platforms.
